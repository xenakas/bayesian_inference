    "Vector Autoregressions (VAR) are standard tools in macroeconomics and are widely used\n",
    "for structural analysis and forecasting. In contrast to e.g. structural models they do not\n",
    "impose restrictions on the parameters and hence provide a very general representation\n",
    "allowing to capture complex data relationships. On the other hand, this high level of\n",
    "generality implies a large number of parameters even for systems of moderate size. This\n",
    "entails a risk of over-parametrization since, with the typical sample size available for\n",
    "macroeconomic applications, the number of unrestricted parameters that can reliably\n",
