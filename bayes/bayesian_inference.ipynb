    "1. Bayesians claim that the parameters are random so that their credible interval is a valid probability argument. This interpretation looks nice but the credible interval of the parameters of interest not only depends on the likelihood but also the prior, which is usually hard to obtain.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. When the likelihood and prior is complicated, the inference has to rely on the MCMC sampling, which can be really slow in most of the real-world cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The biggest controversy about Bayesian inference is that you must quantify your prior knowledge about the question at hand. This makes it possible to actually influence your results, either accidentally or on purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a genuine concern, and any Bayesian analysis worth it’s salt must demonstrate that the chosen priors aren’t influencing the final results. \n",

    "In general, it is worth noting that for most possible choices of the A matrix, the resulting dynamics will not be “stable”, in the sense that the time series $y_1, \\ldots y_T$ will either converge to the zero vector or diverge to infinity, producing rather “uninteresting” dynamics. This can happen quite rapidly, sometimes within 10 or 20 timesteps.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Most regression weights A will yield rather non-interesting dynamics after long time epochs. This motivates extending the model for time series to overcome this tendency, such as using switching VAR processes so that after small amounts of time under some $(A,\\Sigma)$ the system switches to other parameters $(A', \\Sigma')$, which can explain different regimes of time series behavior."

    "\n",
    "It is important to note that under the Matrix Normal distribution, the Kronecker product $\\Psi \\circ \\Sigma$ is identifiable, but the individual parameters $\\Psi, \\Sigma$ are only identifiable up to a constant $c$.  This occurs because for any $\\Psi,\\Sigma$, we can use $\\Psi/c, c\\Sigma$ and achieve the same probability value for matrix $A$.  \n",
    "\n",
